Summary: 
Julian Smith (a Bushfire truck crew leader) introduced us to the problems they face getting accurate information while fighting a fire.

While rich information about the area and current state is available, the fire trucks themselves are reduced to radios and paper maps (sometimes not even those).

Working with the customer we determined that the fire fighters almost always work in close proximity to their trucks, and that the trucks are currently undergoing an upgrade to provide a mesh network for the purposes of providing sensor data back to the control rooms.

This information is not readily available to the fire crews, but with the help of a (tiny) local server and the fire fighters own personal devices rich information about Victoria (VicMaps) could be joined to realtime information from the trucks, and user/crew entered data about points of interest.

Together with a team of 8 people we developed a prototype offline "cloud" to help provide information and tracking during the fire. 

The team is committed to getting the application (and supporting hardware) to a trial within several firetrucks.

Why we are working on this problem: 
Better information to the fire crews will help save lives and properties.

What we accomplished during the event: 
Developed a prototype, and formed a team that will see the prototype through to trial within a small group of firetrucks.

Progress made since the event: 
Organised future work

Traction: 
The team is committed to seeing the solution through to a trial within a group of firetrucks, and is working with Julian to make this happen.

Next steps: 
Finish development of a beta & trial in a small number of trucks
